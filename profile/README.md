## 🔥 Key Features – Lock & Delete

Here’s what you get when you plug in the right aimbot:

* **🔍 Auto Aim:** Locks on targets the moment they’re in view.

* **📏 FOV Config:** Adjust how aggressive the aim is – wide or narrow zones.
* **🕹️ Smooth Aim:** Natural movement that mimics real player input.
* **🧠 Bone Selection:** Target heads, necks, torsos – whatever works for your playstyle.
